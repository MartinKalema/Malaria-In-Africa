# Malaria in Africa Data Science Project

## Project Overview

This data science project is aimed at analyzing and understanding the prevalence, distribution, and influencing factors of malaria in Africa. Malaria remains a significant public health challenge in many African countries, and this project seeks to provide insights that can inform public health interventions and policies.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data from various sources, including epidemiological data, environmental factors, healthcare infrastructure, and socio-economic indicators for African countries.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Prepare and clean the collected data, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure its quality and usability.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform in-depth exploratory analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data. Visualize key insights for a better understanding of the malaria situation in Africa.

4. **Statistical Modeling**: Develop predictive models to assess factors influencing malaria prevalence and identify high-risk areas. Explore machine learning algorithms for predictive accuracy.

5. **Geospatial Analysis**: Utilize geospatial data and mapping tools to visualize the geographical distribution of malaria cases and identify hotspots.

6. **Data Visualization**: Create informative and visually appealing graphs, charts, and maps to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

7. **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and healthcare organizations to improve malaria control and prevention strategies in Africa.
